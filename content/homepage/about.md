## ✏️ About Me
Hi, I am Benson! 👋 I am a computer science major at UCLA who is passionate about teaching. 📝 I am someone who likes to help students understand the *why* behind what they are learning, particular for computer science & cybersecurity. This website acts as a single place to hold any content or resources I develop for classes I help teach. It also is a small project to let me try out Hugo.

If you are a student in one of my classes, feel free to reach out to me via email or on Piazza. I am always happy to help! 🤗 If you are a fellow instructor interested in chatting about education, I am happy to do that as well. 👨‍🏫
